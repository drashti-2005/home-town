                The clothing style in Kumbhan village beautifully blends
                tradition with modern trends. Elder women mostly wear sarees
                with regional designs and vibrant colors. Young girls often wear
                kurtas, dresses, pants, and T-shirts, while younger women also
                mix in ethnic outfits like Chaniya Choli for festivals. Men in
                the village traditionally wore Kediyu and Dhoti with turbans,
                but nowadays, young men commonly wear pants, shirts, and
